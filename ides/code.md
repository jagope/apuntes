# Portable mode
Visual Studio Code supports Portable mode. This mode enables all data created and maintained by VS Code to live near itself, so it can be moved around across environments.
Portable mode is supported on the ZIP download for Windows, and the TAR.GZ download for Linux.

## Enable Portable mode#
After unzipping the VS Code download, create a data folder within VS Code's folder. From then on, that folder will be used to contain all VS Code data, including session state, preferences, extensions, etc.

The data folder can be moved to other VS Code installations. This is useful for updating your portable VS Code version, in which case you can move the data folder to a newer extracted version of VS Code.
