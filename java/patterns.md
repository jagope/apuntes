## Singleton

The main idea of it is to ensure that only one single instance of the class could be created at any given time.

#### Static block initialisation
```java
public class <class_name> {

	private static <class_name> instance;

	static {
		instance = new <class_name>();
	}
	
	public static <class_name> getInstance() {
		return instance;
	}
}
```

#### Lazy Initialisation
```java
public class <class_name> {
	    private static <class_name> instance; 
	    private <class_name>() {} 
	  
	    public static <class_name> getInstance()  {
	    	if (instance == null) 
	            instance = new <class_name>(); 
	        return instance; 
	    } 
	
}
```

#### Thread Safe Singleton
```java
public enum <enum_name> {
	INSTANCE
}
```

## Builder

Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern it means its solves the problem related to creation of object.

```java

```
## Factory
## Dependency injection
