# Creational Patterns <a name="creational"></a>
Creational patterns deal with the creation of objects.

## The Prototype Pattern
A Prototype represents a fully initialized instance, to be copied or cloned.

## The Singleton pattern

The main idea of it is to ensure that only one single instance of the class could be created at any given time.

### Types of instantiation:

#### Eager/early instantiation

Instantiated while the class gets loaded.

```java
public class <class_name> {

	private static <class_name> instance;

	static {
		instance = new <class_name>();
	}
	
	public static <class_name> getInstance() {
		return instance;
	}
}
```

#### Lazy instantiation

Instantiation is delayed until the caller method needs the singleton instance.

```java
public class <class_name> {
	    private static <class_name> instance; 
	    private <class_name>() {} 
	  
	    public static <class_name> getInstance()  {
	    	if (instance == null) 
	            instance = new <class_name>(); 
	        return instance; 
	    } 
	
}
```

#### Thread Safe Singleton
```java
public enum <enum_name> {
	INSTANCE
}
```

## The Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern separates object construction from its representation.

```java
public class Coffee {
    class Coffee {
        private Coffee(Builder builder) {
            this.type = builder.type;
	    ...
        }

        private String type;
	...

        public static class Builder {
            private String type;
	    ...

	    public Builder sugar(String type) {
                this.type = type;
                return this;
            }
	    ...

            public Coffee build() {
                return new Coffee(this);
            }
        }

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new Coffee.Builder().type(true).build();
    }
}
```

## The Factory Pattern

The intent of the Factory Method pattern is to create a family of object types. It set an interface to produce an object, but allow sub classes to determine which class to instantiate. Factory method allows a class to delegate to sub classes

# Structural Patterns <a id="structural"></a>
Structural patterns deal with the composition of objects.

## The Proxy Pattern
A Proxy is an object that represents another object.

## The Decorator Pattern
The Decorator pattern allows us to add responsibilities to objects, dynamically.

## The Facade Pattern
A Facade is a single class that represents an entire subsystem.

## Adapter pattern

An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.

The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects.

Example:

# Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus more on the behavior of objects, or more precisely, interactions between objects.

## Dependency injection



## Visitor

Allows for one or more operation to be applied to a set of objects at runtime, decoupling the operations from the object structure.

```java
public interface Visitable {
  public void accept(Visitor visitor);
}
 
public class Book implements Visitable {
   .......
   @Override public void accept(Visitor visitor) {visitor.visit(this)};
   .......
}
 
public class Cd implements Visitable {
   .......
   @Override public void accept(Visitor visitor) {visitor.visit(this)};
   .......
}
 
interface Visitor {
   public void visit(Book book);
   public void visit(Magazine magazine);
   public void visit(Cd cd);
}
```
