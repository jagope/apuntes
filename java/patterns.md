## Singleton

The main idea of it is to ensure that only one single instance of the class could be created at any given time.

### Types of instantiation:

#### Eager/early instantiation

Instantiated while the class gets loaded.

```java
public class <class_name> {

	private static <class_name> instance;

	static {
		instance = new <class_name>();
	}
	
	public static <class_name> getInstance() {
		return instance;
	}
}
```

#### Lazy instantiation

Instantiation is delayed until the caller method needs the singleton instance.

```java
public class <class_name> {
	    private static <class_name> instance; 
	    private <class_name>() {} 
	  
	    public static <class_name> getInstance()  {
	    	if (instance == null) 
	            instance = new <class_name>(); 
	        return instance; 
	    } 
	
}
```

#### Thread Safe Singleton
```java
public enum <enum_name> {
	INSTANCE
}
```

## Builder

Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern it means its solves the problem related to creation of object.

```java

```
## Factory

It set an interface to produce an object, but allow sub classes to determine which class to instantiate. Factory method allows a class to delegate to sub classes

## Dependency injection

## Adapter pattern

An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.

The main motive behind using this pattern is to convert an existing interface into another interface that the client expects.

Example:

## Visitor

Allows for one or more operation to be applied to a set of objects at runtime, decoupling the operations from the object structure.

```java
public interface Visitable {
  public void accept(Visitor visitor);
}
 
public class Book implements Visitable {
   .......
   @Override public void accept(Visitor visitor) {visitor.visit(this)};
   .......
}
 
public class Cd implements Visitable {
   .......
   @Override public void accept(Visitor visitor) {visitor.visit(this)};
   .......
}
 
interface Visitor {
   public void visit(Book book);
   public void visit(Magazine magazine);
   public void visit(Cd cd);
}
```
